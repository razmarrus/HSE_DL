## About

Welcome to the repository for Jupyter notebooks from the Introduction to Machine Learning Coursera course by the Higher School of Economics University and Yandex School of Data Analysis. <br>
This course covers a wide range of topics from fundamental Gradient Descent techniques to advanced concepts like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image to text.

## Repository Content

There you can find list of topics covered in assignments week by week through Jupyter notebooks.

1. **Week 1: Gradient descent**  implementation with Mini-batch SGD, SGD with momentum and RMSprop
2. **Week 2: Multilayer Perceptron** for digits images classification. MNIST digits classification with TensorFlow
3. **Week 3:** Image Classification with **Convolutional Neural Networks**
4. **Week 4: Autoencoders** for similar image searches.
5. **Week 5:** Text generation with **Recurrent Neural Networks**
6. **Week 6: Bridging Images and Text.** Combination of **LSTM** and pre-trained InceptionV3 model for CNN encoder
